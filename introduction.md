# Introduction
**About this document**

This document describes how to connect MA510 to Azure IoT Central application using the IoT plug and Play model. Plug and Play simplifies IoT by allowing solution developers to integrate devices without writing any device code. Using Plug and Play, device manufacturers will provide a model of their device to cloud developers to be integrated quickly into IoT Central or any solution built on the Azure IoT platform. IoT Plug and Play will be open to the community by way of a definition language and SDKs.
MA510 is an multimode (LTE Cat M1/LTE Cat NB2/EGPRS) LPWA modules that support 3GPP Release 14. it is support global frequency band, global certification, built-in GNSS, integrated MQTT/CoAP/LWM2M and other rich network protocols, support UART/USB/I2C/I2S multiple standard industrial interfaces, and support eDRX and PSM low power mode, PSM as low as 3.2uA, especially suitable for IoT industry applications with wide coverage and low power consumption as core requirements, such as asset tracking, smart meters, smart home, smart parking, municipal street lights
